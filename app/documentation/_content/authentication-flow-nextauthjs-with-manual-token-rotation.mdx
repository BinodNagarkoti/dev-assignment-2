## Authentication Flow: NextAuth.js with Manual Token Rotation

This document outlines the authentication process implemented in this project, which uses NextAuth.js with a manual token rotation strategy. This setup provides a robust and secure way to manage user sessions.

### 1. Initial Login

1.  **Credentials Submission**: The user enters their email and password on the login page.
2.  **Authorization**: The `authorize` function in `lib/auth/config.ts` is called. It verifies the credentials against the stored user data.
3.  **Token Generation**: Upon successful authorization, the `jwt` callback in `lib/auth/config.ts` is triggered. The `handleInitialSignIn` function from `lib/auth/config-utils.ts` is called to generate the initial set of tokens:
    *   **Access Token**: A short-lived token (30 seconds) used to access protected resources.
    *   **Refresh Token**: A long-lived token (7 days) used to obtain a new access token when the old one expires.
4.  **Token Storage**: The access and refresh tokens are stored in `access_token_data.json` and `refresh_token_data.json` respectively.
5.  **Session Creation**: The `session` callback in `lib/auth/config.ts` enriches the user's session with the access token and user information.

### 2. Token Handling and Rotation

*   **Access Token**: The access token is sent with each request to a protected route. The server validates the token to grant access.
*   **Refresh Token**: When the access token expires, the `jwt` callback automatically triggers the `refreshAccessToken` function. This function uses the refresh token to generate a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.
*   **Token Expiry**:
    *   Access Token Expiry: `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY_MS` (currently 30 seconds)
    *   Refresh Token Expiry: `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY_MS` (currently 7 days)

### 3. Middleware and Route Protection

*   The middleware in `middleware.ts` intercepts requests to protected routes.
*   It uses the `getToken` function from `next-auth/jwt` to check for a valid session token.
*   If the user is not authenticated, they can be redirected to the login page (this is currently commented out but can be enabled).
*   If an authenticated user tries to access the login page, they are redirected to the dashboard.

This authentication flow ensures that user sessions are managed securely, with automatic token rotation to minimize the risk of session hijacking.
