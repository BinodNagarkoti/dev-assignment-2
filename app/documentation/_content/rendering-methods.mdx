## Application Rendering Strategies

This documentation provides an overview of the rendering strategies employed across the application, detailing why specific methods are used for different routes.A detailed guide to the rendering methods used throughout this application, including CSR, SSR, and ISR.

### Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

**Route:** `/part_two/auth/login`

**Reason:**
*   **Minimal Data Needs:** The login page is largely static and doesn't require significant data to be fetched on the server before rendering.
*   **Client-Side Interactivity:** All user interactions, such as filling out the form and submitting it, are handled directly in the browser.
*   **Middleware Redirection:** The application's middleware manages redirection for already authenticated users, so the page itself doesn't need server-side logic to handle this.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

**Route:** `/part_two/dashboard`

**Reason:**
*   **Dynamic & User-Specific Data:** The dashboard displays data that is unique to the logged-in user and must be fetched on every request to ensure it's up-to-date.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Rendering the page on the server protects sensitive data and logic, as it is never exposed directly to the client.

### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) + Client-Side

**Route:** `/part_two/users`

**Reason:**
*   **Fast Initial Load (ISR):** The initial list of users is pre-rendered into a static page at build time and periodically updated in the background. This provides a very fast loading experience for users.
*   **Real-Time Updates (Client-Side):** All CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are handled on the client-side. This allows for a responsive and seamless user experience, as changes are reflected instantly without needing to reload the entire page.

### Summary Table

| ROUTE | RENDERING METHOD | REASON |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/part_two/auth/login` | CSR | Minimal data requirements; middleware handles redirection. |
| `/part_two/dashboard` | SSR | Dynamic data unique to the logged-in admin; sensitive data protection. |
| `/part_two/users` | ISR + Client-Side | Initial data cached with periodic updates; real-time CRUD operations. |
